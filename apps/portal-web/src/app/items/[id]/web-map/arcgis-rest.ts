/**
 * Canonical impl lives at `@/lib/arcgis-rest` — moved out of the
 * bracketed route segment so callers from outside `items/[id]/...` can
 * import it without Next.js's webpack choking on the relative `[id]`.
 *
 * This file stays as a zero-cost re-export so the viewer code (which
 * lives alongside this path) keeps working without rewriting imports.
