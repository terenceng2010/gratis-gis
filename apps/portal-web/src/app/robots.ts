 * /why, /credits, /help/*), discourages crawling of the
 * authenticated workspace (item / form / admin routes), and points
 * at the sitemap so search engines can enumerate the public pages
 * in one request rather than discovering them by random crawl.
 *
 * Sitemap URL is built from NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL so a self-host

 * sitemap reference -- relative sitemap URLs are technically legal
 * but several crawlers (Bing, Yandex) handle them poorly.
