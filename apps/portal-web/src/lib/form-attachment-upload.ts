/**
 * Direct-to-MinIO upload helper for form attachments (#280, #233).
 *
 * Form attachments (photo, audio, video, file, drawing question types)
 * used to be base64-inlined into the response JSON. That blew past
 * Nest/Express's default 100 KB JSON body limit on submission, so a
 * single phone photo would 413 the POST. The fix is to PUT the bytes
 * directly to MinIO and store only the URL in the response.
 *
 * Two-phase upload, mirroring the v3 feature-attachments pattern:
 *   1. POST /api/portal/storage/presign-upload to get a short-lived
 *      uploadUrl.
 *   2. PUT the file bytes directly to that URL.
 * The API never buffers the bytes, so submissions stay tiny no matter
 * how large the captured media is.
 *
 * The helper is online-only by design. Form runtime callers fall back
 * to an offline-pending shape (dataUrl, no url) when navigator.onLine
 * is false; the queue drain re-runs this helper to upload pending
 * attachments before posting the submission.
