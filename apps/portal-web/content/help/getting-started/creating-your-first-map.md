A **map** is an item that combines one or more layers with a
viewport and a basemap.  Maps are how you compose data for human
consumption; they're what web apps render and what print templates
print.

## Steps

1. From the items grid (the landing page after you sign in), click
   **+ New item**.
2. Pick **Map** from the wizard.
3. Give the map a title, then click **Create**.
4. You land on the map's detail page.  Click **Open builder**.
5. In the map builder, click **+ Add layer** in the top-left rail.
6. Pick a data layer you have access to and click **Add**.
7. The layer renders with default symbology.  Save with **⌘S** or
   the Save button.

That's it.  You now have a map you can share, embed in a web app,
or print.

## What you do next depends on the use

- **Style the layer**: select it in the layer panel and use the
  Style + Symbology controls.  See **Map editing → Symbology**.
- **Constrain what users see**: add a filter on the layer
  (**Filters** section).
- **Decide what happens on click**: configure popups (**Popups**
  section).
- **Share it**: the **Sharing** section on the map's detail page.

## What the map item stores

The map item's `data` blob includes:

- The list of layers (each with its style, filter, popup config).
- The default viewport (center, zoom, bearing, pitch).
- The basemap binding.
- Per-layer access overrides (separate from the underlying data
  layer's own sharing).

It does *not* duplicate the features themselves — those live in the
referenced data layer items.  A change in the underlying data
layer shows up immediately on every map that references it.
