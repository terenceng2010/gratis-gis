A **data layer** is the native item type for feature data. It owns
one or more PostGIS tables and the schema that describes them.
Maps reference data layers; data layers reference nothing.

## What's in a data layer

- **One or more sublayers**, each backed by its own PostGIS table.
 Sublayers are what get rendered on a map.
- **A schema per sublayer**. Field list with types, domains (coded
 values, ranges), and required flags.
- **Optional related sublayers**. Non-spatial tables whose rows
 reference a parent feature. Used for one-to-many attribute data,
 inspection histories, photo metadata, etc.
- **Optional attachments**. Files (typically photos) bound to a
 specific feature. Stored in MinIO, the metadata row in the
 `feature_attachment` table.

## Importing data

Three ways to get features into a data layer:

- **Upload at create**. The new-item wizard offers a file upload
 step (Shapefile zip, GeoJSON, GeoPackage, KML).
- **Import into an existing sublayer**. The **Layer data** section
 on the detail page has an Import button per sublayer.
- **Submitted via a form**. A form item paired to this data layer
 posts new rows when respondents submit.

## Editing features

Two surfaces:

- **The feature browser** (a section on the detail page) lets you
 view, add, edit, and delete rows attribute-only.
- **A map** that references this layer lets you edit geometry
 graphically. The data layer's own detail page can't do
 geometry editing. There's no map canvas there.

## Exporting

The **Export** dropdown on the feature browser produces CSV, XLSX,
or a full Bundle (XLSX + related tables + attachments) as a ZIP.
See **Bundle export**.

## Versions

Data layers are versioned bitemporally: every edit becomes an
observation in the engine's log. This means:

- **Undo works at every level**. Single-row, batch, layer-wide.
- **Time-travel queries**. Show me this layer as of last Tuesday.
- **Audit trail**. Every observation records who changed what
 and when.

The bitemporal engine is mostly invisible day-to-day. Where you
see it: the **As of** time slider in the map editor and the
**History** column when you right-click a feature in the
attribute table.
