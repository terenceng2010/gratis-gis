Live presence shows you who else has the same map open right now.
Each viewer gets an avatar chip at the top of the canvas, and
their cursor position appears on the map as a colored arrow with
their name.

This is the simplest signal that you're not working alone. When
you're walking a teammate through a map over a video call, you
can move your cursor over the spot you're talking about and they
see it land in real time without you having to describe
coordinates.

## What you see

- **Avatar chips** in the top-right of the canvas, one per
  active viewer. Your own chip is included so you can confirm
  the connection works.
- **Cursor markers** for everyone else: a colored arrow with a
  small name label, drawn at their mouse position on the map.
  Your own cursor isn't drawn (no point self-watching).
- **Distinct colors** per viewer, drawn from a palette of eight
  high-contrast options. Two adjacent viewers always get
  different colors.

## How it works

The map editor sends your cursor position to the server every
couple of seconds and pulls down the latest list of everyone
else's. When you stop moving the cursor, your "last known
position" stays where you left it for a few seconds, then your
chip drops off until you wiggle the mouse again.

Cursors that have been idle for more than 5 seconds disappear so
the canvas doesn't get cluttered with stale arrows.

When you close the tab or navigate away, your chip drops off
immediately for everyone else.

## Privacy notes

- Only viewers who can already read the map ever see anyone
  else's presence. A private map's avatar list is gated by the
  same permission check as the map itself; nothing leaks.
- Phase 1 is signed-in only. Anonymous public-link visitors do
  not appear in the avatar strip.

## What ships in Phase 1

Phase 1 uses periodic polling. Phase 1.5 will switch to a live
WebSocket connection so cursors track each other at sub-second
latency. The visible UX stays identical; only the smoothness of
cursor motion changes.
