If you're used to building apps in Esri's tooling, here's where
the equivalents live in GratisGIS.

## Esri Web AppBuilder → GratisGIS Custom Web App

The closest one-for-one. AGO's Web AppBuilder is a drag-and-drop
widget builder bound to a web map. GratisGIS's **Custom** web app
template is the same shape: pick a layout, drag widgets in, bind
them to a map, configure each widget's options, save.

Widget catalog overlap (incomplete, growing): map, layer list,
basemap gallery, search, attribute table, legend, print, measure,
draw, splash, swipe, edit, layer effects. Several Esri-specific
widgets (Smart Editor with detailed editing config, Near Me,
Coordinate) don't have direct equivalents and are tracked as
follow-up work.

## Esri Experience Builder → GratisGIS Custom Web App

Experience Builder is more flexible than Web AppBuilder (full-page
layouts, multi-page apps, data injection between widgets). The
GratisGIS Custom template handles single-page widget composition;
**multi-page** custom apps are tracked as future scope. For now,
if you'd build an Experience with two pages, build two GratisGIS
web app items and link between them.

If you're recreating an Experience that was just "a map with
widgets" (most are), the Custom template covers that today.

## AGO Operations Dashboard → GratisGIS Dashboard

Same item type, same shape. A grid of widgets, each bound to a
layer or query, refreshing on a configurable interval. Differences:

- **Layout.** Both are grid-based; GratisGIS uses a row/column
 grid with explicit widget sizes (Esri's dashboard uses a
 flexible row/column with optional grouping). The result is
 visually similar; the editor feels slightly different.
- **Filters.** GratisGIS's "filter chip" widget covers the
 selector / category-filter pattern; cross-widget filtering is
 by shared layer + field binding.
- **Data sources.** GratisGIS dashboard widgets source from data
 layers, derived layers, or ArcGIS service items. There's no
 separate "data expression" concept; if you need a computed
 series, build a derived layer first and bind to it.

## AGO Instant Apps → GratisGIS Web app (Viewer / Editor)

Esri's Instant Apps are templated single-purpose apps (Sidebar,
Media Map, Compare, etc.). GratisGIS has two templated single-
purpose web app variants today: **Viewer** (read-only map) and
**Editor** (read + edit on permitted layers). The other Instant
App patterns (Compare, Story-style) are tracked as future scope.

## AGO Survey123 web app → GratisGIS Web app (Survey response)

The Survey123 default web app for taking a survey corresponds to
the GratisGIS **Survey response** web app template: a single
form, no surrounding map, public-friendly URL.

## What's missing today

Honest list of Esri concepts that don't have an equivalent right
now:

- **StoryMaps**. The narrative-with-embedded-maps format. Tracked
 as future scope.
- **Workforce / Field Maps configuration**. The GratisGIS field
 PWA is the field-facing surface; the configuration concepts
 (assignments, dispatcher) are simpler today.
- **GeoForm** (the older AGO survey app). Use **Form** with a
 Survey response template instead.
