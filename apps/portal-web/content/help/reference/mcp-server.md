The GratisGIS MCP server lets compatible AI clients (desktop
assistants and code editors that speak the Model Context
Protocol) read items and layer features from your portal
directly. The server is a small standalone Node program that
runs on the user's machine and connects to the portal over
plain HTTPS.

This is a power-user feature. Most viewers and contributors
will never need it. It's documented here for anyone who wants
to plug their portal into an MCP-compatible tool.

## What the MCP server does in Phase 1

Three read-only tools:

- **list_items** — paginated browse of items the caller can
  read, optionally filtered by item type and free-text query.
- **get_item** — full metadata for a single item by id.
- **read_layer_features** — GeoJSON FeatureCollection for a
  data layer, capped per call so a large layer doesn't fill
  the model's context window.

Phase 2 will add write tools (run a tool, create a data layer
from GeoJSON).

## How it runs

The MCP server is a Node.js script under `apps/portal-mcp/`
in the GratisGIS repo. It speaks the standard MCP stdio
transport: the client (your AI tool) spawns it as a
subprocess and talks to it over stdin / stdout. There's no
port to open, no socket to expose, and no inbound network
access required on your machine.

Every request the MCP server makes against your portal is a
normal authenticated HTTPS call, gated by the same permission
checks any other client gets.

## Setup

1. Clone the GratisGIS repo on the machine running the MCP
   client.
2. From the repo root: `cd apps/portal-mcp && npm install &&
   npm run build`.
3. Configure your MCP client to spawn the built binary,
   passing two environment variables:
   - `GRATIS_GIS_BASE_URL` — the URL of your portal API
     (typically the same domain your portal-web is served
     from, e.g. `https://gratisgis.org`).
   - `GRATIS_GIS_TOKEN` — a bearer token for an account with
     the permissions you want the AI client to use.
4. Restart the MCP client. The three tools should appear in
   its tool palette under the server name you configured.

## Getting a bearer token (Phase 1)

Phase 1 uses a long-lived bearer token. You can get one from
your browser's developer tools while signed into the portal:

1. Open the portal in a logged-in browser.
2. Open DevTools → Application → Cookies.
3. Copy the access token from the session cookie.
4. Paste into the `GRATIS_GIS_TOKEN` environment variable in
   your MCP client config.

The token expires when your portal session expires (minutes
to hours, depending on your deployment's Keycloak settings).
When it does, the MCP server will start returning errors;
sign back in and refresh the env var.

This is rough by design. Phase 1.5 will add a dedicated
portal API-key page so you can generate a long-lived token
that doesn't expire mid-session and that you can rotate from
the portal UI without touching cookies.

## What an AI client can actually do with this

A few realistic prompts that work today, given a connected
portal:

- "What data layers do I have access to?"
- "Show me the first 200 features from the `parcels` layer
  near Charleston, WV."
- "Find all maps in my portal with `flood` in the title."

The AI client decides how to use the tools; the MCP server
just exposes the contracts. Anything the bearer token can't
do via the regular HTTP API, the MCP server can't do either.

## Privacy and audit

Every call the MCP server makes is logged by your portal-api
exactly the same way a browser request is. Audit logs,
sharing checks, geographic clips, and time-bounded scopes all
still apply. The MCP server is a thin facade; it doesn't
bypass any portal rules.
