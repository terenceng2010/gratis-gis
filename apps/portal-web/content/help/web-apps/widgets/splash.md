The **Splash widget** renders a portal-rooted modal dialog every
time the app loads.  Drop one onto a Custom Web App canvas, edit
the title and body, and it appears in the runtime.

## How to add one

1. Open your Custom Web App in the builder.
2. From the **Page** group in the left palette, drag **Splash** onto
   the canvas.  It shows as a placeholder card (the modal itself
   is portal-rendered to `document.body` at runtime, not on the
   canvas grid).
3. In the right rail, edit the **Title** and **Body**.  The body
   uses the same WYSIWYG editor as the Text widget — bold, italics,
   headings, lists, links, color.

## Options

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Plain text shown in the dialog header. |
| **Body** | Markdown stored, edited via WYSIWYG.  Renders as the modal body. |
| **Confirm button label** | Default "OK".  Useful for "I agree" / "Continue" / etc. |
| **Size** | Small (400px), Medium (600px, default), Large (800px), or Custom width clamped 280-1200px. |
| **Show "Don't show again" checkbox** | When on, the user can dismiss the splash for future visits.  Their preference is stored in `localStorage` keyed by app id + content hash. |
| **Require confirmation** | When on, the modal has no close X, escape does nothing, and clicking outside doesn't dismiss.  The user must click the confirm button.  Use for terms / disclaimers. |

## Dismissal memory

The "Don't show again" key includes a hash of the splash's
**title + body + confirm label**.  When you edit any of those, the
hash changes and everyone who previously dismissed sees the new
splash on their next visit.

This is by design — it would be a bug if a re-authored disclaimer
went unseen because users had dismissed an older version.

## When not to use it

- **Don't gate critical info.**  Users tune out modal walls; if the
  info needs to persist, put it on the page itself or in a
  Container.
- **Don't put it on every app.**  Repeated splashes train users to
  click OK without reading.  Use it for genuinely-rare events
  (first visit, version change, ToS update).
