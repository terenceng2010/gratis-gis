The **Search** widget renders a search bar that queries one or
both of:

- A **geocoder** (location search: addresses, places).
- One or more **layers** (feature search: by field text).

Picking a result zooms the map to the location or feature and
opens its popup.

## What it does

The search box accepts free text. The widget queries the
configured sources in parallel and shows a grouped result list:

- **Locations**: results from the geocoder, with the parsed
 address and coordinate.
- **Features**: matching features from each configured layer,
 with the layer name and the matched field value.

Each result is clickable.

## Configuring sources

In widget config:

- **Geocoder**. Pick from the org's configured geocoders. Set
 to "None" if location search isn't relevant for this app.
- **Layers**. Add one or more bound layers. For each:
  - **Field(s) to search**. Default: the layer's title-like
    field. Add more for multi-field search.
  - **Display template**. How the result row renders. Same
    `{field}` interpolation as popups.
  - **Result limit**. How many to return per query.

## Suggestions vs. full search

Two modes:

- **Suggestions** (default). The search runs as the user
 types; results update with a debounce. Best for short
 indexed-field searches.
- **Submit-only**. The search only runs on Enter or click. Use
 for slow or expensive searches.

## Keyboard

- `/` focuses the search box from anywhere in the app (if the
 widget is visible).
- Arrow keys navigate the result list.
- Enter activates the focused result.
- Esc closes the result list.

## Notes

- **Indexed fields search fast.** If a feature-search field is
 a long string and the layer has 100k+ features, expect slow
 results; ask an admin to add a trigram index.
- **Search scope respects sharing.** Only features the viewer
 can read appear in results; features behind a per-share geo
 limit are filtered.
