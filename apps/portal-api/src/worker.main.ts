/**
 * portal-worker entry point (#115 P8).
 *
 * Runs the same image as portal-api but bootstraps a standalone
 * Nest application context (no HTTP listener) that loads only the
 * worker-side modules. The ImportJobsWorker's polling loop keeps
 * the process alive; SIGTERM / SIGINT closes it cleanly.
 *
 * Why a separate process instead of a thread:
 *   - The Node event loop is process-scoped. CPU-heavy work in
 *     the worker (gdal-async feature pumps, EWKT serialization,
 *     COPY stream encoding) blocks every other piece of JS in
 *     the same process. With the worker in its own container,
 *     the api stays responsive to user requests no matter what
 *     the worker is doing.
 *   - Horizontal scale: scaling the worker doesn't drag the api
 *     with it. A burst of imports just spawns more
 *     portal-worker containers; the api stays at its baseline.
 *   - Memory isolation: a runaway import that OOMs the process
 *     only kills the worker, not the api.
 *
 * Co-deployed with portal-api: same docker image, different
 * CMD. The container shares the staging volume with the api so
 * files uploaded via POST /ingest/stage are readable here.
