/**

 * Sits between the Item-level gate (Phase B's SharingService) and
 * the read pipeline. The Item gate decides whether the principal
 * can use the lens at all; this service decides whether each
 * individual row in the lens output is visible to the principal.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *
 *   1. Caller verifies `SharingService.canRead(user, item)`. Failure
 *      -> 403; LensPolicyService is never called.
 *   2. Caller pre-computes spatial predicates per feature in
 *      PostGIS. Cedar's published WASM doesn't ship a geometry
 *      extension; we evaluate `ST_Within(...)` / similar in SQL,
 *      distill to a Set<string>, hand the set to Cedar.
 *   3. Caller invokes `checkFeature` per feature; this combines an
 *      implicit "allowed past the Item gate" baseline with the
 *      lens's policy text and runs the Cedar evaluator. forbid
 *      rules in the lens text subtract from the baseline.
 *   4. Rows that come back `decision: 'deny'` are filtered out of
 *      the response.
 *
 * Cedar's forbid-trumps-permit semantics is the load-bearing
 * property: the lens policy can only *narrow* what the user can
 * see, never broaden. A misauthored lens that accidentally writes
 * `permit (principal, action, resource);` cannot let a viewer see
 * data they couldn't see at the Item level, because the Item-level
 * gate already happened upstream.
 *
 * No-policy case: a lens with `policy === undefined` (or empty
 * string) is a passthrough; every feature the read pipeline emits
 * is allowed. We short-circuit before constructing the entity
 * store so a no-policy lens reads at the same speed as before.
