/**
 * COPY-based bulk writer for the observation table (#115 P3 + P9).
 *
 * Why this exists separately from EngineService.writeMany:
 *
 * The streaming-INSERT path through Prisma's $executeRawUnsafe goes
 * through the SQL parser, parameter binder, and protocol round-trip
 * for every batch. For an online write of one or two rows, that
 * overhead is a rounding error. For a million-row import, it's
 * minutes of wall clock spent in the pipe rather than the disk.
 *
 * `COPY ... FROM STDIN` is PostgreSQL's bulk-load wire protocol. We
 * stream rows as TEXT-format CSV-ish lines (tab separators, \\N for
 * null, geometry as EWKT so PostGIS parses on input) and the server
 * applies them with no per-row SQL parsing. Empirically 5-10x
 * faster than batched multi-row INSERTs for large imports.
 *
 * P9 worker-thread split: encoding observations to COPY lines
 * (per-coordinate EWKT, JSON.stringify on attrs, four regex passes
 * in escapeText) is CPU-bound. With everything on one thread the
 * GDAL feature pump and the COPY-stream writer were forced to wait
 * on the encoder. Moving the encoder to a worker_thread lets the
 * main thread keep pumping features and writing bytes while the
 * encoder works on the previous batch in parallel. On real-world
 * county-scale parcel imports (some polygons have 50000+ vertices)
 * this is roughly a 2x throughput win.
 *
 * Caveats:
 *   - We open a separate pg connection (pg-copy-streams needs the
 *     raw client; Prisma doesn't expose its underlying pool). The
 *     connection is short-lived: opened at the start of a job,
 *     closed at the end.
 *   - Geometry is encoded as EWKT (`SRID=4326;POINT (...)`),
 *     skipping ST_GeomFromGeoJSON entirely. PostGIS parses EWKT
 *     considerably faster than GeoJSON.
 *   - The `cell` h3 index is set null in the bulk path; #115 P4
 *     dropped the index that justified per-row computation.
 *   - This path bypasses derived-layer cache invalidation
 *     (notifySourceWrite). The worker fires a single bulk
 *     invalidation after the COPY completes -- cheaper than
 *     N per-row calls and good enough for the staleness window
 *     between import-finished and the next regular write.
