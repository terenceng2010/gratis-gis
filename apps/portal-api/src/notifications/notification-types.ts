/**
 * Catalog of notification types the user can opt in / out of, with
 * human-readable labels + descriptions and a category for grouping
 * the preferences UI. The catalog is server-driven (rather than
 * hard-coded in the web app) so adding a new NotificationType is a
 * one-place edit: append an entry here, the settings page picks it
 * up automatically.
 *
 * Defaults live alongside the catalog. `defaultEnabled` records
 * whether the type fires for a user with no `notification_preference`
 * row stored. The matching default in NotificationsService.notify()
 * reads this same value so the UI and the worker agree on the
 * "what fires when no row exists" answer.
 *
 * Categories are intentionally a small fixed set:
 *   - sharing: events about items shared with the user
 *   - account: events about the user's own account lifecycle
 *   - editor:  events about features collected via editor items
 *
 * Channels are also fixed today (email only). The shape is per-type
 * + per-channel because Phase 3 will add webhooks / in-app and a
 * user might want share_created over email but not over webhook.
