/**
 * Public entry point for any service that wants to notify a user.
 * Resolves the user's preferences, looks up their delivery
 * address, enqueues a Notification row per enabled channel, and
 * returns. Actual delivery happens asynchronously in the worker.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 *
 *  - Resolve the address at enqueue time (not send time). A user
 *    changing their email between trigger fire and worker drain
 *    should still receive the message at the address current when
 *    the trigger fired -- that matches "this email was correct
 *    at the moment the share was created", which is what an audit
 *    of the queue should be able to reconstruct.
 *
 *  - Preferences default to enabled when no row exists. The
 *    `notification_preference` table only stores divergences from
 *    the default, so a fresh org with no per-user prefs still
 *    gets every notification. Phase 3's settings UI writes rows
 *    only when the user opts out of something.
 *
 *  - NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED env gates the whole platform. When
 *    false, notify() is a no-op (logs a debug line). Lets an
 *    admin who doesn't want emails in their stack flip the
 *    feature off without uninstalling code.
 *
 *  - Errors during enqueue are swallowed and logged: a failure to
 *    enqueue should NOT roll back the user-facing action that
 *    triggered it. A share creation succeeding but the
 *    notification not being queued is far better than the share
 *    creation failing because the notifications table is locked.

   *   - Pins userId to `actingUserId` (the form owner) for FK +
   *     audit purposes. Notification.userId is required by schema;
   *     using the owner's id keeps "show me everything we sent on
   *     behalf of user X" queries working.
   *   - The address arg is what the worker uses; the row's
   *     resolveAddress() lookup is bypassed.
