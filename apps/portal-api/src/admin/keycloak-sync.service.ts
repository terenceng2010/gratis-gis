/**
 * Eager Keycloak -> Prisma user mirror.
 *
 * Background. The Prisma `user` table is a mirror of the Keycloak
 * realm. Historically that mirror was populated lazily by
 * AuthSyncService on the first authenticated request from each user.
 * That worked while users only changed by signing in, but breaks the
 * moment a user is added to or removed from Keycloak without ever
 * logging in again:
 *
 *   - Newly seeded / invited users (Last login = "Never") didn't show
 *     up in the principal picker until they signed in for the first
 *     time, so an author couldn't share an item with them.
 *   - Users removed from Keycloak (or renamed via username swap) kept
 *     lingering in Prisma forever, surfacing as ghosts in the picker
 *     and as orphan principals on existing share rows.
 *
 * `reconcile()` closes that gap. It pages through every realm user,
 * upserts each into Prisma keyed on username (matching the auth-sync
 * key choice for seed-vs-IdP coexistence), and soft-deletes any
 * Prisma row whose realm entry is gone. Soft-delete (rather than
 * hard delete) keeps existing FKs valid: the user's items still
 * resolve, the share rows that pointed at them stay as audit
 * history, and a future "delete permanently" admin action can run
 * the existing reassign-then-cascade flow (#138).
 *
 * Triggered from three places:
 *   - portal-api boot (app.module bootstrap hook), so the picker is
 *     correct from the first page load even on a fresh process;
 *   - the housekeeping cron (hourly), so drift gets corrected
 *     between boots;
 *   - an admin "Sync now" button on /admin/users, for the impatient
 *     case where someone just invited a user and wants the picker
 *     to know about them right away.
 *
 * Idempotent and safe to call repeatedly. Failures (Keycloak
 * unreachable, admin client not configured) are logged and
 * swallowed: a stale mirror is preferable to a broken portal-api.
