 * Canonical shape stored in a `web_app` Item's data when
 * `template = 'custom'`. The Custom Web App template is the
 * "designer-first" companion to Viewer / Editor / Survey: where
 * those templates ship with a fixed UI and a small config knob set,
 * a Custom app is a free-form layout of widgets the author drags
 * onto a canvas and binds to data sources individually.
 *
 * Inspirations: Esri Web AppBuilder + Experience Builder. The two
 * camps split because Esri tried to support both "quick configurable
 * app from a template" (Web AppBuilder) and "full-bleed designed
 * experience" (Experience Builder); we want one balanced surface
 * that doesn't feel like a stripped-down copy of either. The widgets
 * are extensible (each carries its own `kind` discriminator and
 * config object), so adding a new widget is "ship one widget renderer
 * + one designer panel" rather than reshaping the schema.
 *
 * Authorization: targets list reuses ViewerTarget shape so the same
 * share + geo-limit pipeline applies. Authoring permission is
 * orthogonal -- only owners / admins can edit the layout, but
 * anyone with view permission on the web_app item plus its
 * referenced layers can render it.
 *
 * See docs/web-app-templates.md and #261 for the broader template

// (sticky top bar, side dock, slideout overlay, inline accordion,
// etc.) is fully prop-driven so a single widget kind covers what
// used to be four separate ones (app-bar / dock-panel / slideout /
// foldable-group).
//
// The container does NOT bake in slot props (no title, no subtitle,
// no logo URL).  An author who wants a header label drops a Text
// widget at the top.  An author who wants a logo drops an Image
// widget.  An author who wants tools drops the tool widgets in
// directly.  This keeps the framework out of the business of
// deciding what belongs inside.
//
// Children inside a container ignore `layout.col / row / colSpan /
// rowSpan` — the container's own `layout` prop (row / column)
// determines child placement.  The grid coords stay on the widget
// object so the same widget can be dragged out of a container back
// onto the page grid without losing position metadata.

 *     dominant surface.
 *   - 'flat': borderless flush on surface-1.  Minimal themes.
