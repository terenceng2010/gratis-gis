/**
 * Canonical shape stored in an Item's dataJson when `type = 'editor'`.
 *
 * An Editor is an online, tool-driven workspace for creating, editing,
 * and deleting features against one or more data_layer items. It pairs
 * with the data_collection item type (form-driven, offline-capable
 * field capture) to replace Esri's sprawling Map-Viewer-edits /
 * Survey123 / Field Maps / Workforce surfaces with two concise items
 * each owning one workflow.
 *
 * See docs/editing-and-collection.md for the full design.
 *
 * Authorization is conjunctive and never escalating:
 *   1. data_layer.editing.policy gates whether the layer is editable
 *      at all.
 *   2. The Editor item config (this shape) narrows from there: drop
 *      fields, lock geometry, restrict row scope further.
 *   3. The share grant on the Editor item narrows per recipient.
 *   4. Geo limits on shares clip rows to a polygon.
 *
 * Versioned for forward compatibility: bump `version` and write a
 * migrator when a breaking change is needed. The runtime should
 * tolerate missing fields and fall back to defaults so older Editor
 * items keep rendering after additive shape changes.
