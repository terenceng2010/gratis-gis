 * Canonical shape stored in an Item's data_json when
 * `type = 'tile_layer'` (#179).
 *
 * A tile_layer item wraps a single pre-rendered tile container
 * (currently PMTiles only; MBTiles + TPK/TPKX are documented as
 * follow-ups). The uploaded bytes live in MinIO; the item carries
 * the storage key + metadata lifted from the file header at
 * upload time so render-time consumers don't have to re-parse
 * the header per request.
 *
 * Why PMTiles as the only v1 format:
 *
 *   - Open spec (CC0), single file, HTTP-range-request friendly.
 *     MinIO range-serves the file directly; no per-tile compute
 *     on our side. MapLibre's pmtiles protocol plugin reads the
 *     file with range requests from the client.
 *   - MBTiles requires SQLite open + per-tile query for every
 *     tile served. Order-of-magnitude more compute and a
 *     dedicated server process. We can ingest MBTiles by
 *     converting to PMTiles at upload, but that conversion is
 *     follow-up scope; for v1 we accept PMTiles directly.
 *   - TPK / TPKX are Esri-proprietary zip-with-metadata. Their
 *     internal format wraps PNG / JPG tiles and an Esri-shaped
 *     JSON conf file. Worth supporting but needs its own
 *     extraction pipeline.
 *   - COG (Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF) is the right answer for
 *     RAW imagery input that we'd tile on-the-fly. Not a tile
 *     container; lives in the separate "generate tile cache
 *     from imagery" surface (also follow-up).
 *
 * Once uploaded, the tile_layer is consumable as a basemap by
 * creating a basemap item with `kind: 'tile-url'` and the
 * tile_layer's `tileUrl` value (which the API exposes as a
 * pmtiles:// URL pointing at the API's proxy endpoint).

/**
 * Container formats served AT REST in MinIO.  Two flavors today:
 *
 *   - **pmtiles** is the universal serving format: range-served
 *     directly by MinIO, MapLibre reads with the pmtiles protocol
 *     plugin, no per-tile compute.  This is what we eventually
 *     converge on for every tile_layer item.
 *   - **cog** (Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF) is the bridge format used
 *     for raw raster uploads.  GDAL normalizes a `.tif` / `.tiff`
 *     / `.geotiff` / `.jp2` to COG at upload, MinIO range-serves
 *     the COG, and MapLibre reads it with the cog-protocol
 *     plugin.  A background worker then bakes the same data into
 *     a PMTiles raster pyramid; once the PMTiles is ready, the
 *     item's served format flips from `cog` to `pmtiles`.  The
 *     COG is preserved as the archival source.
