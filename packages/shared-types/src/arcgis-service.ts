/**
 * Canonical shape stored in an Item's dataJson when `type = 'arcgis_service'`.
 *
 * An arcgis_service item is a thin pointer at a remote ArcGIS REST
 * MapServer or FeatureServer — no feature data lives in the item
 * itself. The viewer queries the service live by bounding box each
 * time a map draws the layer, so the item's job is just to persist
 * the minimum metadata a map layer needs (which URL, which sublayer,
 * what service type) plus a probed-at-creation snapshot of the layer
 * list so the picker doesn't have to re-hit the service every time
 * an author opens Add Layer.
 *
 * The `defaultLayerId` field names the layer a map uses when it picks
 * this item without specifying a sublayer. Services with a single
 * sublayer can omit it; multi-layer services typically point at the
 * most useful index.
 *
 * Authentication tokens are deliberately NOT stored here. That lives
 * on the item's secrets bag (once that infra ships) so share scopes
 * apply to credentials separately from the metadata.
