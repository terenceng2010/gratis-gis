# GratisGIS UX/UI testing checklist

A thorough manual walkthrough of every shipped feature. Aimed at
catching bugs, broken empty states, missing permissions, and
"this used to work but doesn't" regressions. Designed for a solo
maintainer who wants to validate the platform end-to-end before
inviting real users.

**How to use this:**

1. Set up two test accounts in your local Keycloak realm: an
   admin (`admin@local`) and a contributor (`alice@local` in the
   default org, plus `bob@external` in a *different* org for
   cross-org tests). Note their UUIDs.
2. Open this file in a markdown editor that supports interactive
   checkboxes (VS Code preview, GitHub, Obsidian). Or paste
   into an issue and tick boxes as you go.
3. Walk through the sections in order. Each item is *one* concrete
   action with *one* expected outcome. If the outcome is wrong,
   note it inline (`- [ ] item title — BUG: <what happened>`).
4. The sections marked **(known stub)** are documented as not
   shipped; skip them or just verify the placeholder renders
   without erroring.
5. Total walkthrough is ~3-4 hours if you're being thorough.
   Splitting across two sessions is fine.

**Browser matrix:** validate Chrome (latest) at minimum. Firefox
and Safari should both work; one full pass through Section 1-3 in
each non-Chrome browser catches >90% of cross-browser bugs.

**Viewport matrix:** desktop (1920x1080), laptop (1440x900), tablet
(iPad portrait), and mobile (iPhone 13 portrait). The field PWA
section explicitly tests mobile-portrait.

## 0. Pre-flight

- [x] `pnpm infra:up` brings up postgres / keycloak / minio / pg_tileserv / nominatim cleanly
- [x] `pnpm dev` starts portal-api (port 4000) + portal-web (port 3000) without errors
- [x] Local URL `http://localhost:3000` loads the public landing page
- [x] Local URL `http://localhost:4000/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [x] Local URL `http://localhost:8081` loads Keycloak admin console
- [x] Local URL `http://localhost:9001` loads MinIO console
- [x] At least two test users exist in the gratis-gis realm with passwords you know
- [x] At least one user has the `admin` org role; the other has `contributor`
- [x] The dev DB has the latest migrations applied (`pnpm --filter @gratis-gis/portal-api exec prisma migrate status` shows clean)

---

## 1. Authentication & sign-in

### 1.1 Sign-in flow

- [x] **Public landing renders without a session.** Open an incognito window. The landing page should show the org name, hero band, and (if `landingShowPublicItems` is on) public items. No sidebar, no admin chrome.
- [x] **Sign-in CTA navigates to Keycloak.** Click "Sign in" in the top bar; lands on Keycloak's login form.
- [x] **Successful login redirects back to portal.** Sign in as your contributor user; lands on `/items` (or wherever you came from).
- [x] **Bad password shows Keycloak error.** Try wrong password; Keycloak shows error inline, doesn't crash the portal.
- [x] **Session persists across page reload.** After signing in, hard reload — still authenticated.
- [x] **Sign-out works.** Click your avatar -> Sign out -> lands on the public landing again, no session.
- [x] **callbackUrl preserved.** While signed out, navigate directly to `/items/<some-id>`. After sign-in, lands on that item page (not `/items`).
- [x] **Token refresh is silent.** Leave a tab open for >5 minutes and click around. No "session expired" dialogs (Keycloak's refresh-token flow runs in background).

### 1.2 Edge cases

- [x] **Two browsers, same user.** Sign in as alice in Chrome and Firefox simultaneously. Both sessions work; making a change in one and refreshing the other shows the change.
- [x] **Auto-disable.** As admin, set alice's `autoDisableAt` to a date in the past. Alice (already signed in) can keep working until token refresh; new sign-in attempts fail.
- [x] **Password reset flow.** As admin in `/admin/users`, click reset password for alice. Email or Keycloak-side reset link works.

---

## 2. Public landing page

- [x] **Org name + hero render.** Configured branding (title, subtitle, hero image) appears.
- [x] **Public items grid populates.** If at least one `access: public` item exists, it shows in the grid.
- [x] **Item card click opens runtime.** Clicking a card opens the runtime (e.g. viewer for a viewer web_app, in a new tab via `target="_blank"`).
- [x] **`landingShowPublicItems = false` hides the grid.** Admin toggles this in `/admin/branding`; public landing now shows just the hero + sign-in CTA.
- [x] **Empty-state copy.** With no public items, the grid section shows "Nothing has been shared publicly yet" instead of crashing.
- [x] **Schema.org JSON-LD is present.** View source; `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag exists with `CollectionPage` + `ItemList`.
- [x] **Project marketing section.** With `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_LANDING=1` (or `?preview=project` query param), the open-source project section renders below the hero.
- [x] **Authenticated user lands but sees public CTA become "Open my items".** Sign in, navigate to apex domain again; CTA now says "Open my items" and links to `/items`.

---

## 3. Items list

### 3.1 Browse and filter

- [x] **Default scope is "My items".** Lands on `/items`; only items owned by the current user appear.
- [x] **All items toggle.** Click "All items"; visible item set expands to include items shared with the user / org / public.
- [x] **Search bar filters.** Type partial title; grid narrows; clears on backspace.
- [x] **Type filter chip.** Click a type chip (e.g. "Maps"); grid narrows to that type. Multiple type chips combine OR.
- [x] **Owner filter.** As admin viewing "All items", filter by another user's id; grid narrows.
- [x] **Bbox filter ("In this area").** Toggle the area filter; only items whose bbox intersects the current map extent show.
- [x] **Tag click filters by tag.** Clicking a tag chip on an item card narrows to all items with that tag.

### 3.2 Folders

- [x] **Folder rail renders.** Left sidebar shows folder tree; can expand/collapse.
- [x] **Click a folder navigates.** URL becomes `/items?folder=<id>`; main grid shows that folder's contents.
- [x] **Breadcrumbs above grid.** Clicking a parent breadcrumb navigates back up.
- [x] **Create folder.** "+ New folder" button opens prompt; new folder appears in rail.
- [x] **Drag item into folder.** Drag a card from the grid onto a folder in the rail; item now appears in that folder.
- [x] **Subfolder creation.** Nest a folder inside a folder; rail shows the hierarchy.
- [x] **Smart folders (saved query).** Create a smart folder; populate criteria; verify items matching the criteria appear.
- [x] **Folder cycle prevention.** Try to make folder A a child of folder B that's already a child of A; portal refuses.
- [x] **Folder share cascades.** Share a folder with bob; bob can see all items inside.

### 3.3 Item creation

- [x] **+ New button.** Clicking opens `/items/new` wizard.
- [x] **Type picker shows all groups.** Five groups visible: Data, Maps, Apps, Analysis, Organize. Each group has the right tile set.
- [x] **Pick "Data layer" -> wizard advances.** Proceeds to step 2 with a title field + an Import tab.
- [ ] **Import tab probes a GeoJSON.** Drop a small `.geojson` file; wizard shows feature count + field schema.
- [ ] **Import tab probes a Shapefile zip.** Drop a `.zip` containing `.shp + .shx + .dbf + .prj`; same probe surface.
- [ ] **Import tab probes a GeoPackage.** `.gpkg` works.
- [x] **Import tab probes a GDB zip.** `.zip` of a File Geodatabase works.
- [ ] **Type-specific inputs render.** Pick "Connected service" (or ArcGIS service); URL field appears with probe button.
- [ ] **Probe a known good ArcGIS REST URL.** Wizard auto-detects the protocol and fills in defaults.
- [ ] **Wizard step 2 access selector.** Three options: Private / Organization / Public; descriptions render under each.
- [x] **Submitting creates the item and redirects to the detail page.**

### 3.4 Item context menu

- [x] **Right-click (or three-dot) menu opens.** On an item card.
- [x] **Share opens sharing panel.** With current shares + access level prefilled.
- [x] **Edit opens metadata edit page.** `/items/[id]/edit`.
- [x] **Delete soft-deletes.** Item moves to trash; disappears from list.
- [x] **Add to folder works.** Item appears in chosen folder.
- [ ] **Reassign owner (admin only).** Visible only to admins; transfer flow completes.

### 3.5 Empty states

- [x] **No items at all.** New user with zero items sees a "Create your first item" CTA.
- [x] **No items in a folder.** Empty folder shows "This folder is empty".
- [x] **No items match search.** Search for nonsense; "No items match" copy renders.

## 12. Engine substrate (CLI verification)

> Connect to the dev DB with `psql` for these.

- [ ] **`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM observation;`** Returns the current row count.
- [ ] **Per-partition count.** `SELECT tableoid::regclass, COUNT(*) FROM observation GROUP BY tableoid;` Shows current month with most rows.
- [ ] **Partition list.** `SELECT inhrelid::regclass FROM pg_inherits WHERE inhparent = 'observation'::regclass;` Shows monthly partitions; >24 entries.
- [ ] **pg_partman registered.** `SELECT parent_table, partition_interval, premake FROM partman.part_config;` Shows the observation entry.
- [ ] **No legacy fs_ tables.** `SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname='public' AND tablename ~ '^fs_[0-9a-f]{32}_';` Returns 0 rows.
- [ ] **Engine read works.** `SELECT DISTINCT ON (entity) entity, attrs FROM observation WHERE scope = 'data_layer:<id>:<key>' AND valid_to IS NULL ORDER BY entity, valid_from DESC LIMIT 5;` Returns recent feature rows.
- [ ] **Cedar is loaded by portal-api.** Boot log shows `[PolicyService] Cedar engine ready (sdk=4.10.0, lang=4.5)`.

## 13. Cross-cutting concerns

### 13.1 Performance gut check

- [ ] **Items list loads in < 1s.** With ~50 items.
- [ ] **Map page first paint < 2s.** With one data_layer source of ~1k features.
- [ ] **Tile fetch p95 < 300ms.** Pan around at typical zoom; no obvious tile jank.
- [ ] **Form runtime opens in < 1s.** Even on a slow mobile network (Chrome devtools "Fast 3G").

### 13.2 Error states

- [ ] **404 for missing item.** Renders a friendly "Item not found" page, not a stack trace.
- [ ] **403 for inaccessible item.** Same shape as 404 to avoid existence probing (matches the docs/auth-model.md spec).
- [ ] **API error in client.** Trigger a deliberate failure (rename a layer mid-edit on the API side); UI shows a toast / inline error, doesn't crash.
- [ ] **Network error.** Disable network; click around; UI shows offline indicator if applicable; doesn't crash.
- [ ] **Stale token.** Manually expire the JWT in localStorage; next request silently refreshes or redirects to sign-in.

### 13.3 Accessibility

- [ ] **Keyboard navigation through items list.** Tab moves through cards; Enter opens detail.
- [ ] **Sharing panel keyboard accessible.** Tab + Enter operate every control.
- [ ] **Focus indicators.** Visible on all interactive elements (no `outline: none` regressions).
- [ ] **Screen reader hits.** With NVDA / VoiceOver, the items list announces item types + titles.
- [ ] **Color-contrast.** No `text-muted` on `bg-surface-2` reads under 4.5:1.

### 13.4 Mobile

- [ ] **Items list responsive.** Cards stack on phone width.
- [ ] **Map editor falls back to mobile layout.** Right-rail pane becomes a slide-out.
- [ ] **Form runtime mobile.** Tap targets are large enough; geo-capture works.
- [ ] **Field PWA.** Already covered above.

### 13.5 Browser extensions / quirks

- [ ] **uBlock Origin doesn't break the public landing.** Common ad-blocker filter lists shouldn't false-positive any portal endpoint.
- [ ] **1Password / autofill.** Sign-in form accepts password from a manager.

---

## 14. Documentation surface

- [ ] **README links resolve.** Click every link in the top half of the README; each lands on a real doc.
- [ ] **ROADMAP reflects shipped state.** Spot-check 3 random "[x]" items and 3 "[ ]" items; reality matches the marker.
- [ ] **/docs/architecture/observation-log-engine.md is current.** No stale fs_ references.
- [ ] **/docs/architecture/cedar-policy-integration.md is current.** Includes Phase D wiring.
- [ ] **/docs/migration/from-arcgis-online.md walkthrough.** Try the steps end-to-end with a small AGO export.

## When you're done

Tally bug-noted items; group by severity:

- **Sev 1 (blocker):** Anything that loses data, leaks data across orgs, or blocks the user from completing a core flow (sign-in, create item, edit, share).
- **Sev 2 (major):** Visible bug that has a workaround. UI glitch that misleads.
- **Sev 3 (minor):** Cosmetic / typos / nitpicks.

File Sev 1s as GitHub issues immediately; batch Sev 2s + 3s into a "v1 polish" milestone.

Re-run Section 11 (WebMap interop) and Section 12 (engine
substrate CLI) after every meaningful engine change. Re-run
Sections 1-3 after any auth / sharing / items list change.
Full pass after every ROADMAP-level milestone.
