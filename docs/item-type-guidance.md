# Item type guidance

When to introduce a new top-level `ItemType`, when to fold something
into an existing type as a template/variant, and what's the line
between the two. Written when we consolidated `editor` into
`web_app` (#258, 2026-05-03) and noticed the same question would
come up the next time someone reached for a new app surface.

## The default: app-shaped surfaces are `web_app` templates

If you're building something users would describe as "an app that
runs on top of an item", the default is to add it as a `web_app`
template variant rather than a new top-level item type. So far that
covers:

- **Editor** (`web_app` with `data.template === 'editor'`) — adds
  drawing/editing tools on top of one or more `data_layer` targets.
  Folded in via #258.
- **Viewer** (planned, see roadmap below) — read-only map app with
  Zoom, Pan, Query, Layers, Legend, Attribute Table, Select, Print.
- **Survey-response viewer / editor** (planned) — opens onto a
  `form` item's submission collection.
- **Custom (visual designer)** (planned) — drag-and-drop widget
  layout, balanced between Web AppBuilder simplicity and
  Experience Builder flexibility.
- **Dashboard** (planned, later) — read-only KPI / chart layout on
  top of one or more `data_layer` items. Deferred until the simpler
  templates ship.
- **Story map / scrolly map** (future) — narrative layout on top of
  one or more `map` items.

The shared parts of the `web_app` shape (title, description, sharing,
folder membership, lifecycle) come for free. Only the
template-specific config lives in `data.config`.

## Template roadmap (2026-05-04)

Matt's prioritization for the Web App Builder, in order:

1. **Basic Read-Only Viewer** — Zoom, Pan, Query, Layers, Legend,
   Attribute Table, Select tools, Print. The bread-and-butter "share
   a map publicly or with a group" surface. This is the first
   template to ship after the editor consolidation lands because it
   reuses most of the editor's read-side runtime (MapLibre canvas,
   layer panel, attribute table) without the editing tools.
2. **Editor** (already exists, gets folded into the same template
   registry via #258) — same shell as the viewer, plus the editing
   toolbar and per-target write policy.
3. **Survey Response Viewer / Editor** — opens onto a `form` item's
   submission collection. View, filter, edit responses; ties into
   the related-records work already done for the field runtime.
4. **Custom (visual designer)** — drag-and-drop widget designer.
   Design philosophy: aim for a balance between Esri's Web AppBuilder
   (simple, opinionated, fast for new users) and Experience Builder
   (powerful but overwhelming for infrequent users). Widgets pulled
   from a curated palette, not a free-form canvas.

**Dashboards are deferred** — more complex (chart/KPI authoring,
data binding, per-tile filtering) and will come after the four
templates above. When dashboards land, they land as a `web_app`
template too, not their own item type.

The runtime layout of these templates is intentionally similar so
users can move between them without re-learning. Editor IS Viewer
plus tools. The custom designer's "viewer widget" should be the
same component the standalone viewer renders. This lets us share
runtime code across all four templates instead of forking it.

## The exception: dedicated `ItemType` when the data shape is genuinely different

A new top-level `ItemType` is justified when **the data shape is
substantially different from anything else**, not just when a new
piece of UI happens to need a home. Examples that earned their own
type:

- **`form`** — owns a versioned schema, a submission collection, and
  an offline-capable runtime. Not a templated app on top of someone
  else's data; it IS the data.
- **`data_layer`** — owns PostGIS-backed feature tables, an
  ingest/replace pipeline, and per-layer indexing. Schema and
  storage are the whole point.
- **`data_collection`** — pairs a `form` with a `map` for offline
  field deployments. Has its own lifecycle (deployment manifest,
  per-device cache, queue manifest). Distinct enough that "Form +
  Map = Deployment" reads better than "Web app with template =
  data_collection".
- **`map`**, **`pick_list`**, **`geo_boundary`**, **`folder`** —
  each owns a domain-specific data shape that other items reuse.

The litmus test:
1. Does the type need a Prisma column or table not on `Item`?
   If yes, it's its own type.
2. Does the type carry its own per-row data outside `Item.data`?
   If yes, it's its own type.
3. Does the type have specialized server endpoints beyond the
   standard `Item` CRUD? If yes, it might be its own type.
4. Otherwise, it's a `web_app` template. Use a dedicated route
   (`/items/[id]/web-app/<template>/`) and a `data.config` shape
   for the template-specific bits.

## The editor case (#258)

Editor passed test #1 (no Prisma changes needed) and test #2 (its
data lives in `Item.data` like every other item) but had specialized
server endpoints (editor-policy enforcement, dependency-access
matrix). When this judgment call came up, we decided the endpoints
weren't a strong enough reason — the type guard inside an endpoint
can switch on `(item.type === 'web_app' && data?.template ===
'editor')` instead of `item.type === 'editor'` and do the same
work. So editor folded in.

If a future template grows server endpoints that are genuinely
distinct from web_app's general handling, that template can still
get its own controller without becoming a top-level type — the
controller path can be `web-app/<template>/...` rather than
`<template>/...`.

## Discoverability

When a `web_app` covers many templates, "show me my editors" still
needs to work. Two ways the items list filter handles this:

1. **Type chips** stay simple: `web_app` is one chip. No
   sub-chip-explosion.
2. **Template facet** appears as a secondary filter when `web_app`
   is selected. Templates are discoverable but stay out of the way
   when not needed.
3. **Smart folders** (#38) accept a `template` clause subject so
   "all editor items owned by me" is one saved query.

## Migration pattern (for the next consolidation)

When you fold an existing top-level type into a `web_app` template:

1. **Don't drop the enum value** in the same release as the data
   migration. Keep it as deprecated so any in-flight API consumers
   don't crash. Drop it in a follow-up release once you're confident
   the migration covered everything.
2. **Write the type guard helper** (`isEditorItem(item)` style) and
   replace every literal `item.type === 'editor'` with it. The helper
   reads `(type === 'web_app' && data?.template === 'editor') ||
   type === 'editor'` during the deprecation window, then collapses
   to the first half once the enum value is gone.
3. **Use `IF NOT EXISTS`-style idempotency** in the Prisma migration
   so re-running the migration on an already-converted database is
   safe.
4. **Do the URL move (if any) in a separate slice** from the
   data-shape change so a regression in one is easier to bisect.
5. **Update the create wizard** to bias new items toward the new
   home, but keep a quick-pick that still says "Editor" so the
   user-facing word doesn't change.
