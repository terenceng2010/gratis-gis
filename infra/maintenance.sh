# Routine prod-host maintenance. Reclaims disk that accumulates as a
# normal side-effect of `docker compose build` runs (the deploy
# pipeline) and tidies log scratch. Idempotent and safe to run
# after every deploy.
#
# Usage:
#   ./infra/maintenance.sh           # run everything below
#   ./infra/maintenance.sh --dry-run # report what would happen
#
# What this DOES touch:
#   - Docker build cache (the big one; every `docker compose build`
#     leaves intermediate layers behind that pile up to 50+ GB
#     within a few weeks of active deploys)
#   - Dangling Docker images (untagged images from previous builds
#     that the latest deploy superseded)
#   - /tmp/deploy-*.log (the per-deploy stdout we capture; useful
#     during a deploy, useless a day later)
#   - /var/cache/apt (apt's downloaded .deb cache; not strictly
#     prod's but tidy)
#
# What this DOES NOT touch:
#   - Postgres data (volumes are mounted, not part of the image
#     layer chain)
#   - MinIO data (same)
#   - Backup archives (those have their own retention via the
#     backup module's `retentionDays` config)
#   - Container logs (Docker's json-file driver rotates these;
#     don't fight it)
#   - Anything under /opt/gratis-gis (the repo + node_modules
#     are tiny anyway)
#
# Recommended cadence: weekly on a quiet hour, or after any deploy
# where the build cache materially grew. Cron line is in the
# README's "Operations" section.
